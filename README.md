# Wang-Landau Algorithm

The [Wang-Landau
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_and_Landau_algorithm) is a method
to iteratively estimate the density of states for a physical system. It is an
example of what is termed a "flat-histogram" algorithm. To find more
information on the algorithm, check out the Wikipedia page, my report (in
`report/main.pdf`) and the citations in the report!. To check out my
implementation, check out `wang-landau/src/`.
